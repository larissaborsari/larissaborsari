## Hey 🖖

My name is **Larissa**, I'm graduated in ***Environmental Engineering*** 🌎 and I found myself passionate about *technology* during my studies, when I had to solve many logical problems and deal with all sorts of data analysis. That leaded me to become a learner of the tech ways , so here I am now, taking another challenge and *looking for self improvement*!  

🔹 Living in Brazil - SC 📍

🔹 Always looking for global opportunities 🔍

🔹 *"Apressa-te a viver bem e pensa que cada dia é, por si só, uma vida. / Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.”* (Lucius  Annaeus Seneca)
