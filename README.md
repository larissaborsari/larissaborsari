# Hey 🖖

My name is **Larissa**, I'm a ***Software Engineering student*** who's learning to code and looking for self improvement. I'm already graduated as ***Environmental Engineer*** 🌎 and I found myself passionate about *technology* during my first graduation, when I had to solve many logic problems and deal with all sorts of data analysis. That leaded me to take another undergraduate degree, so here I am now, taking another challenge and *loving every step of this road* 🖤 🤍!
